## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.js and npm.

To see if Node is installed, run ```node -v``` in a terminal/console window. This should print a version number.
To get Node.js, go to https://nodejs.org.

npm is installed with Node.js. To see if an npm client is installed, run ```npm -v``` in a terminal/console window. This should print npmâ€™s version number.

1. Clone the repository with

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/tom2022/tms.git
```

and cd into the tms folder.

2. Now, install the Ionic CLI and the Angular CLI globally with
```sh
$ npm install -g ionic

$ npm install -g @angular/cli
```
(Users of Windows should open an Admin command prompt.
Mac/Linux users should run the command with sudo.)

## Serving the web application

Running the TMS Mockup app in a browser is as simple as running the following command in the created root folder:

```sh
$ ionic serve
```
